		<h2>The Elevator Pitch</h2>
		<div class="custombody">
			<p style="color:white">
				I am a recent graduate from Western Washington University in Bellingham, where I got my
				Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science. I am currently working as a Software Developer at a
				local tech company. My studies have covered topics ranging from object oriented design to
				algorithms to networks, giving me a well-rounded understanding of everything that goes into
				a program.
			</p>
			<p style="color:white">
				I have a passion for software development with experience in end-to-end full-stack development,
				low-level computer systems, and database systems. I very much enjoy exploring the world of
				computers and am always excited to take on a new challenge that will push my current level of
				understanding. The majority of projects that I have worked on have been written in Java or C,
				but I am also comfortable with Python, JavaScript, SQL, and many other languages.

				<h3>Non-Technological Hobbies and Interests</h3>
				<div class="custombody">
					<li>French</li>
					<p class="custombody">
						In highschool, I took French as my foreign language. I only had the opportunity to take it for
						two years, but always wished I could have pursued it longer. So, I've been working on learning
						more french at home in my freetime. It's a tough process, learning a language, but it is very
						rewarding being able to communicate with enitre groups of people that I never would have been
						able to otherwise. Si vouz parlez francais, j'aimerai parler avec vous!
					</p>
					<li>Bouldering</li>
					<p class="custombody">
						One of my favorite things to do is go bouldering, and I find time to go to one of my local gyms
						many times a week (when not in the midst of a pandemic). I've found that bouldering is not only
						fun, but a great way to get some exercise and socialize, too. I encourage anybody to give it a
						try!
					</p>
					<li>Motorcycles</li>
					<p class="custombody">
						Not soon after I learned how to walk, I learned how to ride, and it's nearly just as important
						to me as walking, too. I've owned a number of bikes throughout the years, and have ridden even
						more. Currently, I have a 2010 Yamaha XT250 as my commuter and a 1984 Honda Nighthawk 650 as a
						bit of a project bike. Pictured to the left is my first street-legal motorcycle, a 1992 Yamaha
						SECA II, which I bought when I was sixteen.
